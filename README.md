Examples
--------
These plugins are simple examples to demonstrate various capabilities.

 * [examples/binary_diff_compare.rb](examples/binary_diff_compare.rb) - Analyze two binaries and perform a differential analysis against them. Displays the percentage difference of the two binaries and what function were modified, by how much and their corresponding matched function.

 * [examples/count_unique_instructions.rb](examples/count_unique_instructions.rb) - Iterate over every instruction in every code block and count the number of unique instructions based on their mnemonic.

 * [examples/disassemble_arbitrary_bytes.rb](examples/disassemble_arbitrary_bytes.rb) - Example to disassemble an arbitrary byte stream for the various supported architectures.

 * [examples/locate_elf_section_header_items.rb](examples/locate_elf_section_header_items.rb) - Example to traverse a models structure in order to search for some data.

 * [examples/module_dependency_graph.rb](examples/module_dependency_graph.rb) - Example to analyze multiple binaries and generate a dependency graph based each binaries module imports. The graph is either displayed in the GUI or saved as an SVG file.

 * [examples/multithreaded_folder_analysis.rb](examples/multithreaded_folder_analysis.rb) - Example to perform analysis on multiple binaries in parallel and then save them to the Relyze library.

 * [examples/add_model_info.rb](examples/add_model_info.rb) - Add some example information to a model which is displayed in the overview.
 
 * [examples/colors.rb](examples/colors.rb) - Simple example to show how to set the color of a models structure items, functions, blocks or instructions.
 
 * [examples/test_entrypoints.rb](examples/test_entrypoints.rb) - Test the various entry points of an Analysis plugin, including manually running the plugin, invoking the plugin via a keyboard or popup menu shortcut or via the analysis pipeline.
 
 * [examples/patch_nonexec_section.rb](examples/patch_nonexec_section.rb) - Patch the Characteristics of a PE section which contains the entry point if that section is not already marked as executable.
  
 * [examples/unmangle_type.rb](examples/unmangle_type.rb) - Unmangle a (Microsoft, LLVM or Borland) mangled name and generate a corresponding data type for it and for example generate a pointer to this type.

 * [examples/metasm_integration.rb](examples/metasm_integration.rb) - Test loading and using the Metasm library.
